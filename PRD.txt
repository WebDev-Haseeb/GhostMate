Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Name

**Ghostmate.online** — A progressive web platform for anonymous, time-limited, and emotionally engaging conversations.

---

## 1. Vision

Ghostmate.online is a privacy-first communication platform that allows people to connect anonymously through fleeting, meaningful exchanges. Every interaction resets daily to encourage spontaneity and emotional honesty without lasting digital footprints. The system is designed for curiosity, connection, and mystery — all while maintaining strong user privacy and smooth technical performance.

---

## 2. Core Concept

Upon login by google, the users will be assigned a unique 8-digit numeric IDs for a day.

At **12:00 AM (server time)**, all chat data, messages, and IDs are deleted. Users must rebuild their connections daily by re-favoriting their partners, keeping streaks alive through mutual effort. The platform balances anonymity with accountability through limited interaction rules and connection tokens.

---

## 3. Functional Overview

### 3.1 User Flow

1. **Google Sign-In (Mandatory)**
    - All users must log in with Google.
    - Show a clear privacy notice:*“Your Google account is only used for verification and to maintain your connections. Your personal data will never be shared or displayed.”*  Message can be tweaked a bit focusing on letting users know that their data will always be private.
2. **ID Generation**
    - Each logged-in user is assigned a new **8 digit numeric ID** every day at midnight.
    - IDs are unique for the day and expire automatically at 12:00 AM.
3. **Messaging Rules**
    - Users can initiate up to **5 new chats per day** (with 5 unique IDs).
    - Once a conversation starts, both users can exchange messages until midnight.
    - All messages and chat histories are auto-deleted at reset time.
4. **Favorites and Connections**
    - Users can mark others as “Favorites.”
    - If both users favorite each other:
        - A **connection token** is generated.
        - The next day, that connection appears under **“Connections You Made.”**
        - The streak count increases by 1.
    - Mutual favorites **cannot be unfavorited** until the next day.
    - If both fail to re-favorite on the next day, the streak resets to 0 and they lose track of each other.
5. **Streaks**
    - Each mutual connection’s streak is tracked daily.
    - Streak count is displayed beside the connection under “Connections You Made.”
6. **Highlights and Stories**
    - Users can highlight messages they find meaningful.
    - If both users highlight the same message, it’s queued for **admin review.**
    - Approved highlights appear as anonymous “**Stories**” on a global feed for 24 hours.
7. **Random Connect**
    - Users can use “Random Connect” to instantly pair with a random active ID and start chatting.
    - Each random match also counts toward the daily limit of 5 conversations.
